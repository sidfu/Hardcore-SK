# Time Bombs

This is Rimworld game mod which allows to make a time bomb from any explosive by installing a detonator.

* __Every thing is a bomb__. If a thing can explode it can be a time bomb: ammo, grenades, mines, fuel and so on.

* __Manual or remote arming__. Radio detonator can be armed in any time, but mechanical one - only by a pawn.

* __Cook in field__. You don't need a workbench to make a time bomb from explosive. Combine part.A and part.B and it's done.

* __Stealth__. Operating with detonator will not trigger any sleeping enemy.

*Where is detonator!*
