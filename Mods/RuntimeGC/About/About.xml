		How could you salvage your over-sized savegame?
		How could you make your game running smoothly as it used to be?
		Well,you're lucky because you're using this mod!
		
		You can:
		-Remove unnecessary World Pawns to alleviate burden of GameSystem
		-Clear AvoidGrids to reduce the size of your savegame
		-Remove useless members(dead or of other factions) in an animal family
		-Remove filth in HomeArea, and snow
		-Remove corpses in current map
		-Remove BattleLog entries
		-Fix some faction relationships error(Those caused by mod conflicts are not included!)
		-Re-generate faction leaders to fix some CommTable issues.
		-Reclaim Memory used by GameSystem to boost up game performance
		
		Usage:
		1.Activate this mod(after Core mod)
		2.Load your savegame
		3.Find a tab called "RuntimeGC" at the bottom of your screen
		4.Click,and do some cleaning with the GUI
		
		Enjoy!
		
		PS. The longer you played(year-in-game),the more effective this cleaning will be.
		PS2. Sometimes errors occur like "Tried to remove xxx from RimWorld.WorldPawns,but it's not here."They're unavoidable as I should thouroughly de-register every pawn(to avoid further bugs).But,they're harmless,so just ignore them.
		PS3. Post any errors or bugs on my forum page.Your effort contributes to a better mod.Thanks!
		PS4. (Too expensive to buy)
