You can install and enable this mod at any time.

&lt;size=24&gt;Uninstallation&lt;/size&gt;
You can disable and uninstall this mod at any time.  However, after you disabled the mod, you'll see some error popping up the first time you load a save with this mod.  It is safe to just override the save file, and you will not see the error message any more.
