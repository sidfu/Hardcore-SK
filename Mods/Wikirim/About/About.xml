	<description>A comprehensive help database, this is a fork of the original "HelpTab", updated to 1.0/1.1 and added changes such as listing humanoid races instead of pawnKinds under "Humanoids". See the Steam page for a full listing of changes.
		A full rewrite is being worked on, this is only kept here as a functional alternative in the meantime. Don't expect support unless it's a critical issue.
		Credits:
		- 1.0/1.1 Update and Changes by Neronix17
		- 17 Update by NotFood
		- A16 Update by Skyarkhangel
		- Original mod by Fluffy
