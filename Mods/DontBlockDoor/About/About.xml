  <description>this MOD fixes a pandemic that has plagued many a world on the Rim: doors being wedged open. whether it's prisoners escaping, invaders rushing in, or temperature leaking out, unwanted open doors have led to disasters in many colonies. my MOD prevents items from being dropped on the same tile as a door, allowing it to close just as intended. after installing this MOD, please avoid placing stockpiles on the same tile as a door. this may cause a bug that will have colonists confused between whether to store an item on that tile or not.
