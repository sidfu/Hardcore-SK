Mods make your save unique among the endless amount of saves you probably played.
If you make it to the end, why not give them some credit too.
After all, credit where credit is due.

This mod adds the authors of your currently active mods to the Credits screen, right after Ludeon employees, testers, and the translators of the currently active language.
Depending on if you want them categorized or just as you have them in load order, there is a mod option available to switch accordingly.
