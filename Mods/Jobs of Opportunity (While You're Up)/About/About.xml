  <description><![CDATA[Vanilla's opportunistic hauling, only better. Although patched for compatibility, the original <i>While You're Up</i> has not changed since added to vanilla back in 1.0. This mod is a direct replacement and significant improvement. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.


<color=teal><b>Haul to inventory support</b></color>
Advanced support for <color=grey><b><i>Mehni's</i> Pick Up And Haul</b></color>!

Only items qualifying as opportunistic will be hauled; solves issue with spread-out stockpiles and <color=grey><b>unloading madness</b></color>.
(Dedicated haul jobs behave as normal, gathering as much as they can.)

<color=teal><b>Skip when bleeding</b></color>
Don't take jobs of opportunity when bleeding.

<color=teal><b>More hauling opportunities</b></color>
By default prefers the proximity requirements set by vanilla, but loosens them to find valid haulables. Adjustable for optimal performance.

<color=teal><b>Optimize hauling to construction</b></color>
If <i>and only if</i> hauling a resource to storage would bring it closer to a blueprint, do that first.
Haul jobs carry more materials, and with <i>Pick Up And Haul</i>, many more.
